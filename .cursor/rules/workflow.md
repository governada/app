# DRepScore Workflow Protocol

## Session Start
1. Read `tasks/lessons.md` for relevant patterns before doing anything
2. Read `tasks/todo.md` for any in-progress work from prior sessions
3. Orient to current state: check git status, recent commits, any open PRs
4. **Orphan audit**: Check `git status` for untracked/uncommitted files from prior sessions. Look for unwired components, unregistered Inngest functions, and missing migrations. These are free value — flag them for inclusion in the current session's first commit or plan

## Planning Phase (Required for 3+ step tasks)
1. Review `tasks/lessons.md` for patterns that appeared 2+ times — propose promoting to cursor rule before proceeding
2. Apply first-principles checklist (see below)
3. Write a plan document to `.cursor/plans/<feature-name>.plan.md` with: goals, approach, phases, affected files/systems, validation gates, and analytics considerations
4. Write actionable checklist items to `tasks/todo.md`
5. Every plan must include explicit **validation gates**: "After step N, validate X before proceeding"
6. **Commit the plan to `main` before creating a worktree.** This is mandatory — the plan must be in the repo so the new worktree conversation can read it. Use commit message: `docs: plan for <feature>`

### Session Chunking for Large Features
When a feature spans multiple areas (IA, UX, visual, data, infra), break it into focused sessions of 15-20 changes max. Each session should:
- Have a single theme (e.g., "IA Restructure", "Visual Identity", "DRep Command Center")
- Be independently deployable and testable
- Preserve strategic context in a shared doc (e.g., `docs/strategy/`) so future sessions maintain alignment
- Complete with a PR and deploy before starting the next session

This prevents context degradation, keeps diffs reviewable, and allows course correction between sessions.

### First-Principles Checklist
Before any plan is finalized, answer:
- **What's the actual problem?** → If the user proposes a solution, diagnose the underlying constraint first. The simplest fix is often the platform's own feature, not an external tool.
- **What's the cost?** → For any decision involving paid tools, infra changes, or migrations, do the cost math before building. What plan, what budget, what does the current platform offer?
- Will this feature need persistent storage? → Start with DB migration, not frontend
- What external APIs/libraries are involved? → Research their behavior, response shapes, and gotchas BEFORE implementation
- What's the validation strategy? → Define checkpoints where partial results are verified
- What does the 6-month version look like? → Build toward it, not away from it
- Could this cause rework of existing features? → Flag the risk explicitly
- Is there a more elegant approach? → If the solution feels hacky, pause and reconsider

## Build Phase
- **Branch check (step 0)**: Before writing any code, run `git branch --show-current`. If on `main` and the task is not a single-commit hotfix, **STOP and create a feature branch or worktree first**. See `git-branch-hygiene.mdc` for the decision logic. This check prevents the most common workflow violation.
- **Research before build**: For any new library/API integration, produce a research summary (exact API calls, response shapes, known gotchas) before writing implementation code
- **Fast validation**: For any pipeline (sync, migration, backfill), validate first 3-5 results before running to completion. Report validation results before proceeding. Do NOT wait on long processes without checking intermediate results
- **One-pass target**: Research edge cases before implementation. Target zero fix commits after a feature commit
- **Database-first**: Any feature that reads external data must go through Supabase. No new direct-API paths to the frontend
- **Analytics inline**: Every new user-facing interaction must include its PostHog event at creation time, not as a follow-up. If you create a button, form, or state change a user triggers — add the `posthog.capture()` call in the same diff. Reference `analytics.mdc` for naming conventions.
- **No orphaned components**: Every component created in a session must be imported and rendered somewhere in the same commit/PR. A component that exists only as a file is invisible debt — it will be forgotten. If a component isn't ready to wire in, don't build it yet.
- **Deprecation audit**: When removing or replacing a system (preferences, wizard, scoring model, etc.), search for all consumers of its **data and state** — not just direct imports of deleted files. Hooks, effects, API routes, and conditional logic that depend on the removed system's output will silently break if not updated.

## Continuous Learning Protocol
- **On correction**: When the user corrects you on ANYTHING, immediately append to `tasks/lessons.md` with: date, pattern, context, takeaway
- **On surprise**: When an API/library behaves unexpectedly, log it
- **On rework**: When a plan changes mid-execution, log why
- **On debugging**: When debugging takes more than 2 attempts, log the root cause
- **Rule promotion**: During planning, if a lesson has appeared 2+ times or represents a permanent architectural decision, propose creating/updating a cursor rule

## Hotfix Protocol

When the user says **"hotfix"**, **"hotfix this"**, or **"hotfix to production"**, this is a trigger to autonomously fix, commit, push, and validate — end to end. Do NOT stop at "code complete" and wait for instructions. The full sequence is mandatory:

1. **Fix the bug** on `main` (hotfixes are direct-to-main, no branch/PR)
2. **Stage only bug fix files** — never stage docs, cursor rules, or unrelated changes
3. **Write commit message** to `commit-msg.txt` (PowerShell has no heredoc), prefix with `fix:`
4. **Commit**: `git commit -F commit-msg.txt`
5. **Push**: `git push origin main` (pre-push hook runs type-check + tests ~25-40s — wait for it)
6. **Monitor CI**: Poll `gh run list --branch main --limit 1` until conclusion is `success` or `failure`. If failure, read logs, fix, re-push.
7. **Wait for Railway deploy** (~5 min after push). Budget the time — do not skip.
8. **Post-deploy validation**: Run the full validation sequence from `deploy.md` (health check, Inngest sync, smoke tests, feature-specific verification)
9. **Report**: Concise summary of what shipped, deploy status, and validation results

**Key distinction from Ship It Checklist**: Hotfixes skip branch creation, skip PR creation, skip CI watch for PR checks. They go straight to main because the bug is already triaged and the fix is confirmed.

**When to use hotfix path vs. PR path**: If the user explicitly says "hotfix" and the fix is a targeted bug fix (not a new feature, not a migration, not a security change), use this path. If the change touches auth/security, scoring, or database schema, push back and recommend the PR path even if the user says "hotfix".

## Ship It Checklist (Mandatory after implementation)

When all code changes compile clean (`npx tsc --noEmit`), run these steps **immediately and autonomously**. Do not report "code complete" and wait — the feature is not done until step 9 passes. Deploy failures caused by your changes are your responsibility; fix and re-push immediately.

0. **Verify GitHub CLI auth**: Run `gh auth status`. If the active account is NOT `drepscore`, run `gh auth switch --user drepscore` before any `gh` commands. The `tim-dd` account lacks collaborator perms on `drepscore/drepscore-app` — PRs and merges will fail silently or with cryptic errors.
1. **Check branch**: `git branch --show-current`. If on `main`, create a feature branch first: `git checkout -b feat/<name>`.
2. **Parity check**: Verify any new `app/` files that import Supabase have `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`.
3. **Stage specific files** (never `git add -A`):
   ```
   git add <files>
   git diff --cached --stat
   ```
4. **Commit** (write message to file — PowerShell has no heredoc):
   ```
   # Use Write tool to create .git/COMMIT_MSG, then:
   git commit -F .git/COMMIT_MSG
   ```
5. **Push** (pre-push hook runs type-check + tests ~25s):
   ```
   git push -u origin HEAD
   ```
6. **Create PR** (write body to file — inline `--body` breaks in PowerShell):
   ```
   # Use Write tool to create .git/PR_BODY.md, then:
   gh pr create --title "feat: description" --body-file .git/PR_BODY.md --base main
   ```
7. **Wait for CI** (~3-5 min). Branch protection requires `type-check`, `lint`, `test`, `build` to pass. Poll every 30s:
   ```
   gh pr checks <number> --watch
   # Or manual poll:
   Start-Sleep -Seconds 30 ; gh pr checks <number>
   ```
   Do NOT attempt to merge while any required check is `in_progress` or `pending`.
8. **Merge** (squash always, `--admin` bypasses branch protection if needed):
   ```
   gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch --admin
   ```
9. **Confirm Railway production deploy**. Railway auto-deploys on push to `main` via GitHub integration. After merge, verify CI on `main` passes (~3-5 min), then Railway builds the Docker image and swaps (~5-8 min total). Poll CI:
   ```
   $run = (gh run list --branch main --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')
   Start-Sleep -Seconds 60 ; gh run view $run --json conclusion --jq '.conclusion'
   # Repeat until 'success'
   ```
   When CI passes, Railway deploy follows automatically. Hit the affected page on `drepscore.io` to smoke-test.

**After deploying:**
- Check if something was learned during the build → update `tasks/lessons.md`
- Clean up: no stale files, no debug `console.log`s left behind
- Concise summary of changes unless deep review is requested

**Additional rules:**
- **Dependency safety**: Never `npm uninstall` a package without checking if it exists in production deps. Use `npx` for one-time scripts to avoid touching `package.json`.
- **Self-resolve**: Deploy failures from your changes are your responsibility. Fix and re-push — do not wait for the user to report it.

### Analytics Completion Checklist
Before marking a feature complete, verify all five layers. "Analytics inline" catches most events during build, but these are the gaps that consistently slip through:
1. **Client events**: Every new component that renders user-visible content has a `_viewed` event; every interaction (click, toggle, dismiss) has an action event
2. **Server events**: Every POST/PUT API route captures a server event via `captureServerEvent()` with the wallet address as distinctId
3. **Observable loaders**: Any new Supabase table or data dimension has a corresponding `analytics/src/data/*.json.ts` loader
4. **Integrity checks**: Any new table is covered by the integrity system (spam detection, orphan checks, volume alerts)
5. **Dashboard page**: If a new loader was added, either update an existing Observable page or create one, and add it to `observablehq.config.ts` sidebar

## Ambitious by Default — Visual & Experience Quality Standard

DRepScore must be unmistakably premium. Every user-facing surface should look and feel like it was purpose-built — not assembled from a component library. This principle overrides default engineering instincts toward simplicity or minimal bundle size.

**Decision framework for implementation approach:**
1. **Default to the most visually distinctive option.** When choosing between Recharts vs. custom SVG, CSS animations vs. physics-based (Framer Motion/spring), standard components vs. bespoke visualizations — default to the one that produces a result no other app has. The user must explicitly request the simpler option.
2. **Performance is a constraint, not a goal.** Lazy-loading (`next/dynamic`, `ssr: false`), code splitting, adaptive quality tiers (GPU detection), and progressive enhancement handle most bundle concerns. A 200KB lazy-loaded package with zero LCP impact is always acceptable if it produces a premium result.
3. **Every screenshot must be unmistakably DRepScore.** If a component could exist in any shadcn/Next.js app, it needs more work. Custom visualizations (radar, hex score, constellation), branded animations, identity-colored accents, and dark-mode-first polish are the baseline.
4. **"Good enough" creates rework; "premium" ships once.** The constellation hero is React Three Fiber with WebGL bloom — that's the baseline for hero-level visuals. Lazy-loaded, zero LCP impact, GPU-adaptive quality tiers. When choosing between a "simpler" and a "premium" approach for any user-facing visual, the premium path is almost always faster net because it ships once.

**Apply this to:** hero sections, profile pages, data visualizations, OG images, share cards, onboarding flows, and any surface that represents the brand. **Exception:** admin tools, internal dashboards, and developer-facing surfaces can be functional over beautiful.

## Proactive Advocacy Protocol
You are the CTO. Act like it. Do not defer to the path of least resistance.
- **Architecture**: When a simple and robust path both exist, recommend the robust path first. Explain the tradeoff. Let the user choose to simplify — never the reverse.
- **Tooling**: During planning phases or at milestones, proactively check: are there new tools, MCPs, platform features, or workflow improvements that would materially help? Surface them without being asked.
- **Push back early**: If a request would create technical debt, say so immediately with a concrete alternative. Do not silently comply and let the user discover the problem later.
- **Long-term over short-term**: Every recommendation should pass the test: "Will this still be the right choice in 6 months?" If not, advocate for what will be.
- **Visual quality**: When proposing implementation for any user-facing visual, always recommend the approach that maximizes distinctiveness. Reference the "Ambitious by Default" principle above.

## Mode Awareness
If the user's message is a question, discussion, or exploration (not a request for changes), suggest switching to **Ask mode** for cost efficiency. Agent mode burns tokens on tool definitions and proactive exploration that aren't needed for conversation.

## Shell Compatibility (PowerShell — mandatory patterns)

This project runs on Windows with PowerShell. **Do not attempt bash syntax and then fix it — use these patterns from the start.** Agents have failed on these patterns 5+ times; there are no exceptions.

| Task | Correct (PowerShell) | Wrong (bash — will fail) |
|------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Chain commands | `cmd1 ; cmd2` or separate Shell calls | `cmd1 && cmd2` |
| Multi-line commit | Write to `.git/COMMIT_MSG`, then `git commit -F .git/COMMIT_MSG` | `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'..."` |
| Multi-line PR body | Write to `.git/PR_BODY.md`, then `gh pr create --body-file .git/PR_BODY.md` | `gh pr create --body "line1\nline2"` |
| Search files | Use Grep tool or `rg` | `grep`, `head`, `tail` |
| Read files | Use Read tool | `cat`, `less`, `head` |

## Anti-Patterns (Do Not)
- Do NOT create `*_STATUS_REPORT.md` files in the project root — use `tasks/todo.md` for tracking
- Do NOT proceed past a failed or unvalidated step
- Do NOT build features that bypass the Supabase cache layer
- Do NOT wait on long-running operations without intermediate validation
- Do NOT assume library/API behavior — verify first
- Do NOT build before validating the economics of a proposed approach
- Do NOT use `git add -A` without reviewing what gets staged. It picks up `.vercel/`, `.cursor/tasks/`, `commit-msg.txt`, and other workspace artifacts. Always run `git diff --cached --name-only` after staging and `git reset HEAD <file>` for anything that shouldn't be committed. Prefer targeted `git add <specific-files>` over `git add -A`. This is especially critical after cross-branch operations (stash pop, checkout, cherry-pick) where unrelated changes leak in.
