# Governada

**Governance Intelligence for Cardano**

Governada is the governance intelligence platform for Cardano. It serves every participant in the ecosystem — citizens (ADA holders), DReps, SPOs, Constitutional Committee, treasury proposal teams, and governance researchers — through one interconnected data engine.

## What It Does

- **Citizen Matching** — Find an aligned DRep or SPO in 60 seconds via PCA-based governance value matching
- **DRep Scoring (V3)** — 4-pillar accountability scoring (Engagement Quality, Effective Participation, Reliability, Governance Identity) with percentile normalization
- **SPO Governance Scoring** — First-of-its-kind scoring of stake pool operators on governance participation
- **Governance Health Index** — 6-component system health metric with Edinburgh Decentralization Index (7 mathematical metrics)
- **Inter-Body Alignment** — Tri-body analysis showing how DReps, SPOs, and Constitutional Committee vote on the same proposals
- **Treasury Intelligence** — Spending effectiveness, DRep treasury judgment, accountability polls, proposal similarity
- **AI-Powered Narratives** — Epoch recaps, governance briefs, rationale quality analysis, personalized summaries
- **6D Alignment System** — PCA-based alignment across Treasury, Decentralization, Security, Innovation, Transparency dimensions with temporal trajectories

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24.15.x or newer within Node 24 (see `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, and `package.json#engines`)
- npm
- 1Password CLI (`op`) — local runs resolve the staging environment through it
- OrbStack or Docker Desktop for Docker-backed lanes such as Supabase migration replay and the optional Cube local stack

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd governada-app
npm install
npm run dev:doctor               # check local tooling, Node, 1Password, Docker, and git-hook friction
npm run env:doctor               # verify local environment bootstrap
npm run env:run -- npm run dev   # run the app against the staging environment
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Local app runs are **staging-backed** by default. `npm run env:run` injects 1Password-backed credentials declared in `.env.local.refs` into the command — no `.env` file with live credentials is committed or copied into worktrees. Run `npm run dev:doctor` first for local tooling friction, then `npm run env:doctor` for secret-resolution readiness.

OrbStack/Docker is still useful, but it is not the default app data plane. It is required for Docker-backed workflows such as `npm run migrations:verify` and the optional Cube stack in `cube/docker-compose.yml`. Inngest Cloud backs scheduled jobs by default; use `npm run inngest:dev` when testing event delivery locally.

`.env.example` documents optional local-only values such as Koios, VAPID, and mock-auth helpers.

## Architecture

```
Koios API (source of truth)
    ↓  Inngest durable functions (22 functions, 30min-weekly schedules)
Supabase (persistent cache, 33+ tables)
    ↓  lib/data.ts reads
Next.js App (server components + 90+ API routes + client components)
```

All frontend reads go through Supabase via `lib/data.ts`. Direct Koios calls only happen inside sync functions. See `.cursor/rules/architecture.md` for the full technical reference.

## Deployment

Deployed on Railway via Docker. Auto-deploys from `main`. Background jobs run on Inngest Cloud. DNS/CDN via Cloudflare.

```bash
npm run build          # Production build
npm run gen:types      # Regenerate Supabase types (after migrations)
npm run inngest:status # Verify Inngest function health
npm run health:verify  # Release-aware post-deploy verification against production
npm run smoke-test     # Endpoint smoke suite (production profile by default)
npm run test           # Vitest unit/integration tests
npm run test:e2e       # Playwright E2E tests
```

## Security

- HSTS with 2-year max-age, includeSubDomains, preload
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all Supabase tables
- JWT wallet auth with session revocation (Redis + Supabase)
